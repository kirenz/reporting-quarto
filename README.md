# Quarto tutorial

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) (a universal document converter).

It supports executable Python and R code blocks within markdown. This allows you to create fully reproducible documents and reports.

Quarto can render Jupyter notebooks represented as plain text (.qmd) or as a normal notebook file (.ipynb). The [Quarto VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto) includes many tools that enhance working these documents.

You can publish high-quality [articles](https://github.com/quarto-journals/), reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more (take a look at this [gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/) to see some examples)

*Author with scientific markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.*
